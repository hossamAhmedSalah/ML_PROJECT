## Fashion MNIST

>ðŸ‘• Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of [Zalando's](https://jobs.zalando.com/en/tech/?gh_src=281f2ef41us) article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. it was intend for Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

- The report of what we have done -> [report and model evaluation](Image_dataset/Fashion%20MNIST_report.pdf)
  
### Summary
- Representing the images in 3 ways
  - Pixel features representation (28Ã—28) 784 pixel with a column for the label
  - HOG features  representation 70 features
  - PCA 40 features
  - Mix dataset between HOG and PCA
- Building Logistic Regression on each dataset Model hypertuning using GridSearch , Cross validation
- Kmeans (removing the label from the subset of dataset contain only 5 classses)
- Visualising K-means using PCA to create 3 components can be plotted as a 3D clusters
- Building a simpple GUI -> [GUI](Image_dataset/gui.ipynb)
  - you need to download the model from [model](mage_dataset/trained_models/LogisticRegressionPixel.pkl)
